Problems to be worked out.

1.  Gracefully handle people who don't use google logins.
4.  Make the view thingie handle bad queries.
5.  Write a thing that can be used to purge old stuff from the database.
6.  Add a checkbox to the main form so that you can opt-out of the 
    confirmation email.
7.  Per the google docs, it doesn't look like there are good ways to have a 
  calendar thats run by an app.   We can use the credentials of the calendar owner.
