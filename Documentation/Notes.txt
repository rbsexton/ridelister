Google app engine notes
-----------------------------------------------

There is a class of accounts called 'Service Accounts' that are made for 
application running on servers that need to access the google infrastructure

https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/service-accounts

It looks like that isn't the way to go.   The user will need to authenticate in any case,

You need web credentials.

This is complicate.   Ugh.  You need to bounce the user over

Except it gets better - The google frameworks do all the messy things.

Workaround for using easy_install on mac - 

export PYTHONPATH=~/projects/ridelister/lib/

easy_install --install-dir lib  --upgrade google-api-python-client

I had to add "redirect_uris": ["https://localhost:8080/oauth2callback"],

to the client secrets JSON file.

You have to implement this:

So you need session management.  Flask does this - thats why its in the examples.
